# sorryaboutyourOPZ

Quickly made Unity app that takes the MIDI from your OP-Z, and makes sprites from SNES games dance!

There are also visual effects for the drum punch-in effects [the others are not set yet], which have:
* duck == binary
* filter sweep == tube
* loop 1 == bloom
* stereo == vision
* loop 2 == digital glitch
* pitch = ascii
* follow / echo = ramp
* ramp up / fill 1 = analong glitch
* short = mirror
* ramp down / fill 2 = glitch
* long = motion
* random = vignette
